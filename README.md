This repo contains a Jupyter notebook, [curve-fitting.ipynb](curve-fitting.ipynb), which fits curves to the time series (Guam.csv and Hawaii.csv)
using the following models.

* linear
* exponential
* quadratic
* logistic

Results are stored as plots in the images folder. Here are the latest plots for the logistic model:
